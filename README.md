# polyglot_v1_qmk_firmware
Customized QMK firmware for my Polyglot v1 steno keyboard. Modified from [Peter Park's original work on the default Polyglot firmware.](https://github.com/petercpark/qmk_firmware/tree/polyglot-v1)

My computer's OS is in DVORAK permanently, so most of the key changes you see in QWERTY are not real key changes. Rather, they are just helpful for me personanlly, or anyone else using Dvorak.

## STENO layer
Only small changes to the row above the vowels.

## QWERTY layer
No changes made, despite appearances. My computer is in Dvorak, so what you see printed is what my computer outputs when I type the corresponding key. If I were to switch my computer to Qwerty, it would output usual Qwerty keys.

## NUMBER layer
Significant changes.

## SYMBOL layer
Some changes. Output is largely influenced by my computer being in Dvorak.
